## Features
- **Quantum Gates and Circuits**: Apply a variety of quantum gates including Hadamard, Pauli, CNOT, Phase, and SWAP gates.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Run Grover's search algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and more.
- **Task Scheduling**: Manage quantum tasks with dependency resolution, priority-based scheduling, and adaptive rescheduling.
- **Resource Management**: Allocate and monitor resources in multi-threaded execution environments.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize quantum circuits, probability distributions, and Bloch sphere representations.
- **Noise Simulation**: Apply noise models like depolarizing, amplitude damping, and phase flip to simulate real-world quantum environments.
- **Error Mitigation and Correction**: Implement techniques like zero-noise extrapolation, bit-flip code, and Richardson extrapolation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumSim-Framwork.git
    cd QuantumSim-Framwork
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `scipy`, and other dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib networkx scipy
    ```

## Usage
1. **Running the Main Script**: The `main()` function initializes the quantum environment, creates tasks, and executes simulations.
   ```bash
   python Quantum.py
   ```

2. **Configuring Tasks**: Inside `main()`, set parameters like `num_qubits`, `num_threads`, `total_resources`, and `num_tasks` to configure task complexity and simulation environment.

3. **Viewing Simulation Results**: The output includes detailed logging of task execution, resource usage, and simulation results. Quantum circuits and probability distributions can be visualized with matplotlib.

4. **Running Benchmarks**: The framework includes benchmarking tools to compare execution times of different quantum algorithms.
